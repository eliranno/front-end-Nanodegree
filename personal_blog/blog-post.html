                <h3>The best time to travel to Tel Aviv</h3>
                <p>No question, the off-season. In July and August, Tel Aviv is overrun with tourists. Plus it gets really hot in the summer months. Temperatures rise to 31-34 degrees, and the humidity reaches over 80 percent. That means you’ll be sweating.
                    A lot. If you like hot weather, then you’ll really enjoy yourself here because the heat shows no mercy, not even at night. The positive thing about these months is the general mood in the city. The people live outside. Even at night.
                    Eating a watermelon at a beach café at three o’clock in the morning has a lot of charm.</p>
